	Build a social network graph. 
	Compute essential graph metrics (degree, clustering coefficient, centrality, communities 
	Create a baseline bot detection model using graph-based features extracted from the dataset. 
	Apply both a Structural Evasion Attack and a Graph Poisoning Attack on selected bot nodes. 
	Recalculate graph features and evaluate the model again after each attack. 
	Test the detector on clean data to measure the impact of poisoning. 
	Visualize the graph before and after each attack scenario. 
	Compare detection performance across three conditions: Baseline (no attack) 
	After structural evasion 
	After graph poisoning 
	
	Summarize how each attack affects the classifier’s performance and the graph structure.
